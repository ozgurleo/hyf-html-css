      <div id="story"><h2>Story</h2>
      <p> Bleach follows the adventures of <span class="ichigo-color">Ichigo Kurosaki </span>, a high school student with the ability to see ghosts. The early parts of the story focus mainly on the characters. As events unfold, the story begins to delve deeper into the world of these gods of death.</p>
      <p>The story opens with the sudden appearance of Shinigami Rukia Kuchiki in Ichigo Kurosaki's bedroom. She is surprised at his ability to see her, but their conversation is shortly interrupted by the appearance of a "Hollow", an evil spirit. After Rukia is severely wounded while trying to protect <span class="ichigo-color">Ichigo</span>, she attempts to transfer half her powers to <span class="ichigo-color">Ichigo </span>in order to let him face the Hollow on equal footing.<span class="ichigo-color"> Ichigo</span> instead unintentionally absorbs almost all her energy, allowing him to defeat the Hollow with ease. The next day Rukia appears in <span class="ichigo-color">Ichigo</span>'s classroom as a seemingly normal Human, and informs<span class="ichigo-color"> Ichigo</span> that his absorption of her powers has left her stranded in the Human World until she recovers her strength. In the meantime <span class="ichigo-color">Ichigo</span> shelters Rukia in his home and takes over her job as a Shinigami, battling Hollows and guiding lost souls to Soul Society.</p>
      <p>After a few months of this arrangement, in the sixth volume of the series, Rukia's Shinigami superiors interpret her disappearance as desertion, send a detachment to arrest her, and sentence her to death. <span class="ichigo-color">Ichigo</span> is unable to stop Rukia's capture, but with the help of several of his classmates who also possess spiritual abilities and ex-Shinigami Kisuke Urahara, he sets off for the Shinigami base, located in the afterlife realm known as Soul Society. Once there, <span class="ichigo-color">Ichigo</span> and company battle against the elites of the Shinigami military, and are ultimately successful in halting Rukia's execution.</p>
      <p> When Rukia is sentenced to death for her transgressions in the human world and taken back to the spirit world of Soul Society, <span class="ichigo-color">Ichigo</span> heads there to seek out the assistance of Kisuke Urahara and Yoruichi Shihōin, unbeknownst to him as being two exiled Soul Reapers, to allow himself and his friends to save Rukia. After<span class="ichigo-color"> Ichigo</span> and his friends battle many Soul Reapers, it is revealed that high-ranking Soul Reaper Sōsuke Aizen framed Rukia for the crime and has been illegally experimenting on Soul Reapers and Hollows. Aizen plans on taking over Soul Society via use of the Hōgyoku, a legendary substance that can turn Hollows into half Soul Reapers and vice versa, increasing their powers greatly. He escapes into Hueco Mundo, the realm of the Hollows, and later abducts Orihime as she is instrumental in creating the Oken, a power that will allow him to kill the Soul King, the ruler of Soul Society.</p>

<p> After being trained by the Vizards, other exiled Soul Reapers who were unwillingly subjects of Aizen's experiments and developed Hollow powers, <span class="ichigo-color">Ichigo</span> and his friends travel into Hueco Mundo to save Orihime, facing Aizen's army of Arrancars, Hollows given Soul Reaper abilities, who are led by an elite group of ten known as the Èspadas that are composed of ten Arrancars with exemplary strength. Along with Aizen, Gin Ichimaru and Kaname Tōsen, the Èspada as a group possess comparable strength to Soul Society's Gotei 13 Soul Reaper captains. After finally reaching Orihime, Aizen reveals her kidnapping was a distraction to allow him to take Karakura Town, as its spiritual energy is what is needed for the Oken. After training from his father Isshin, another exiled Soul Reaper, <span class="ichigo-color">Ichigo</span> and the Soul Reapers face off against Aizen, Soul Reapers who aligned with his cause, and his most powerful Èspadas, resulting in Aizen's surrender and the loss of<span class="ichigo-color"> Ichigo</span>'s Soul Reaper powers as he uses a sacred technique to seal Aizen away for good.</p></div>

      <div id="fight"><h3>Best Fight Ever</h3>
      <p>Commenting upon Ichigo's words, Aizen tells Ichigo he understands why he has lost his Reiatsu before claiming Ichigo has not "parted" with his Reiatsu, but has instead "thrown it away". Admitting he does not know how Ichigo achieved this, Aizen theorizes Ichigo has turned the entirety of his Reiatsu into raw physical power for his spiritual body, increasing his strength, speed, throwing ability, and so on.</p></div>

                 <br><p id="ichigo"> Ichigo Kurosaki
         
(黒崎 一護 Kurosaki Ichigo) is the main protagonist of the Bleach series. An orange-haired high school student, Ichigo becomes a "substitute Soul Reaper" after unintentionally absorbing most of Rukia Kuchiki's powers. His cynical nature at first makes him ill-disposed towards the duty, but, with the passage of time, he accepts and welcomes the strength his Soul Reaper powers give him. When creating the manga series, Kubo commented that Rukia Kuchiki, the first character he created, did not seem like a lead character, so he created Ichigo to be the series protagonist. Ichigo is voiced by Masakazu Morita in Japanese and Johnny Yong Bosch in English.</p>

      <br><p id="inoue"> Orihime Inoue
(井上 織姫 Inoue Orihime) is a long-time classmate of Ichigo Kurosaki and one of his closest friends. She used to have a crush on Ichigo since the beginning, however due to Ichigo's selfless wish to protect his loved ones, Orihime genuinely falls in love with him. Since the age of three, she had been an orphan when her older brother Sora left their abusive parents' home with her and raised her on his own. Later on, when Orihime was in middle school, he died in an accident. Though initially devoid of spiritual powers, she develops spiritual awareness early in the plot and later obtains the god-like ability to warp reality through rejecting past phenomena. Orihime is voiced by Yuki Matsuoka in Japanese and Stephanie Sheh in English. </p>

He has since become a major protagonist and a consistent ally of Kurosaki. His weapon throughout the series is Zabimaru. Renji is voiced by Kentarō Itō in Japanese and Wally Wingert in English. </p></br>

Rukia Kuchiki (朽木 ルキア Kuchiki Rukia) is a Soul Reaper who is assigned hollow extermination duties in Karakura Town. Rukia meets Ichigo for the first time when she breaks into his house, not knowing that Ichigo can see her. Their relationship further complicates when Rukia tries to save Ichigo and unintentionally transfers too much of her Shinigami powers into him. Rukia is left with little powers left and cannot return to Soul Society. She assumes a temporary lifestyle as a regular human and enrolls into Ichigo's high school and takes up residence in his closet, while teaching him how to be a substitute Soul Reaper in her place. Rukia was the first character of the series created by Kubo, her design being the one he decided to use for all the other Soul Reapers. Rukia is voiced by Fumiko Orikasa in Japanese and Michelle Ruff in English.</p>

  <br><p id="ishida">Uryū Ishida >
Uryū Ishida (石田 雨竜 Ishida Uryū) is a Quincy, a descendant of a line of near-extinct, priest-like, hollow-hunting archers, who were historical enemies of the Soul Reapers.

As a Quincy, Uryū possesses the supernatural power to gather invisible "spirit particles" called reishi from the atmosphere. Once gathered, these particles can be shaped into spirit-energy constructs, foremost among them a bow and arrow,and to fuel various magical spells and superhuman abilities.

Yasutora Sado (茶渡 泰虎 Sado Yasutora), better known as Chad (チャド Chado), is one of Ichigo's friends at school. He is of mixed Japanese/Mexican heritage and a student who towers over his classmates at 6 feet 5 inches. Despite his imposing appearance and fearless attitude he is quite meek and refuses to fight unless it is for the sake of another. When he attempts to protect Ichigo's sister Karin and her friends from a hollow, he discovers a unique ability that strengthens and armors his right arm, enabling him to fight hollows. He is quite loyal to his friends, especially Ichigo, who is one of his closest friends. He displays little emotion except when something or someone he cares about is in danger.
